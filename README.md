# minimal_surface
This code implements the basic algorithm from [this paper](https://vision.in.tum.de/_media/spezial/bib/oswald_toeppe_cremers_cvpr12.pdf), which only computes optimal silhouette-consistent minimal surfaces of given volume with gradient descent on GPU:

Based on a minimal user input, this algorithm interactively determines the objects' silhouette and subsequently computes a silhouette-consistent 3D model which is precisely the globally minimal surface with user-specified volume. In above paper, the authors also proposed the weighted minimal surface which is NOT included in this repository.

## 1. Requirements

This code has three party dependencies:

0) MATLAB (mandatory)

1) [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) (mandatory)

2) [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (mandatory)

## 2. Getting started
This code is tested under:
* Ubuntu 16.04
* CMake 3.5.1
* CUDA 8.0
* MATLAB R2019a

Download the demo [dataset](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/photometricdepthsr):
* `cd pathto/code/data`

* `./download.sh`

Build Mex file:
* Set `MATLAB_ROOT` environment variable in to your installed matlab path, such as

  `export MATLAB_ROOT='/usr/local/MATLAB/R2019a'` in `~/.bashrc`

* In Terminal do
  `cd pathto/code`

  `mkdir build`

  `cd build`

  `cmake ..`

  `make`

* In `build/lib` is the mex file and in `build/bin` is the binary

* `cd ..`

* execute the matlab script `example.m`

## 3. Input
- `mask`: a boolean binary describing the silhouette.
- `volume`: the desired volume of result.

## 4. Parameters
- `max_iter`: the max number of iteration for gradient descent.
- `tol`: the stopping criterion by residual.
- `tau`: the step size for gradient descent.
